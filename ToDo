<Main>
    <ParentMain.py>
        - the highest "main" file in this project; does all the processing
        - GUI processing and queueing
        - Operates webscraping functions based on the needs of the algorithm
        - 
    <Efficiency-Calculator>
        - Data structures analysis on calulating complexity speeds of the different structures
            - possibly allows for a swap between different strucutres in order to find the most efficient one
                - basically have a bunch of DS templates and swap between them (stretch goal)
        <ECMain.cpp>
            -


<Webscraping>
    <WebscraperMain.py>
        - brings it all together lol. watch a youtube video on webscraping and update from here 
        - is run by the processor in order to start webscraping for the correct data

    <ImportAndProcess.py>
        - has the functions that run in WebscraperMain.py
        - places the words into a formulaic sentence structure
